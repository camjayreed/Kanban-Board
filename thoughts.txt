Sidebar
--------------
so for creating elements dynamically instead of attaching buttons everywhere, im thinking create some toggle buttons under our sidebar say where we can

idea #1: 
    toggle todo board > press create text button > text field will then appear on todo board to be edited.
    im thinking to guard some breaks of this we should only allow 1 selection button to be toggled at a time, dont even allow more than 1 to be toggled.

Idea #2:
    use htmls drag and drop api to drag an image of say a text box, to the box of your choice and on drag you will create a text field
    we may have to create some horizontal divs inside of our boards to give these places to be places, possibly we could highlight the div 
    your hovering over.
